            <p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - <br>
                another important game guideline</p>

            <h3>Youtubability</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
            <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong> the clarity <br>
                    of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player. <br>
                <br>
                Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the <br>
                full potential of your game by working on <br>
                getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your <br>
                games. <br>
                <br>
                Many elements can be used to make your <br>
                game clearer: <br>
                <br>
                For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte- <br>
                raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for <br>
                example, can she tell which character she <br>
                <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it <br>
                look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the <br>
                game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 <br>
                seconds (too long!). <br>
                <br>
                Make sure to <strong> use colours</strong> to help indicate <br>
                the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix <br>
                Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted</strong> (in <br>
                orange here) and instantly recognized as <br>
                a threat.

            <p>If you want to run user tests with <br>
                f riends and family or even random <br>
                people in the street, it is interesting to <br>
                show them the 30 second video before <br>
                making them try to prototype in order <br>
                to <b> understand their </b> expectations from <br>
                the video vs. the actual game they try. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Make it obvious</b> with visual elements <br>
                that help <b>understand the objective and <br>
                    controls</b> of the game, like with the <br>
                target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s <br>
                Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw <br>
                Car with the space dedicated to <br>
                drawing.

            <p> People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <b> on their <br>
                    phone’s Facebook feed</b>, everything will seem smaller than when <br>
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <b> You should <br>
                    also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if <br>
                    someone watches iton a small screen</b>. With an average watch time of 3 <br>
                to 5 seconds, this is an <b> accelerated elevator pitch!</b> <br>
                <br>
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on <br>
                YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea <br>
                for your game videos.
