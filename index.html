            <p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong>  - <br>
                another important game guideline</p>

        </div>

        

        <div class="YH">
            <h3>Youtubability</h3> </div>
        <div class="text3">
        <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong> the clarity <br>
            of your gameplay</strong>  to a potential player. <br>
         <br>
         Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the <br>
         full potential of your game by working on <br>
        getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your <br>
         games. <br>
         <br>
          Many elements can be used to make your <br>
           game clearer: <br>
            <br>
          For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte- <br>
          raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for <br>
          example, can she tell which character she  <br>
          <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it <br>
            look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the <br>
             game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 <br> 
             seconds (too long!). <br>
             <br>
             Make sure to <strong> use colours</strong> to help indicate <br>
              the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix <br>
               Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted</strong> (in <br>
                orange here) and instantly recognized as <br>
                 a threat.</p>
