            <p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong>  - <br>
                                                   another important game guideline</p>

        <div class="YH">
            <h3>Youtubability</h3> </div>
        <div class="text3">
        <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong> the clarity <br>
            of your gameplay</strong>  to a potential player. <br>
         <br>
         Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the <br>
         full potential of your game by working on <br>
        getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your <br>
         games. <br>
         <br>
          Many elements can be used to make your <br>
           game clearer: <br>
            <br>
          For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte- <br>
          raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for <br>
          example, can she tell which character she  <br>
          <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it <br>
            look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the <br>
             game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 <br> 
             seconds (too long!). <br>
             <br>
             Make sure to <strong> use colours</strong> to help indicate <br>
              the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix <br>
               Jump, obstacles are <strong> clearly contrasted</strong> (in <br>
                orange here) and instantly recognized as <br>
                 a threat.</p>

        <p>If you want to run user tests with <br>
          f riends and family or even random <br>
         people in the street, it is interesting to <br>
         show them the 30 second video before <br>
          making them try to prototype in order <br>
           to understand their expectations from <br>
            the video vs. the actual game they try. <br>
            <br>
             Make it obvious with visual elements <br>
              that help understand the objective and <br>
               controls of the game, like with the <br>
                target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s <br>
                 Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw <br>
                  Car with the space dedicated to <br>
                   drawing. </p>

                  <p> People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games on their <br>
                     phone’s Facebook feed, everything will seem smaller than when <br>
                      displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. You should <br>
                       also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if <br>
                        someone watches iton a small screen. With an average watch time of 3 <br>
                         to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator pitch! <br>
                         <br>
                          Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on <br>
                           YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea <br>
                            for your game videos.</p>
